# Companion methods

A **companion** is another ReadyVibe skill whose method a skill may need to perform its own promised work. Each skill declares its companions in `metadata.companions`. Companions may be conditional: declaring one does not mean always running it, and a bundle may declare many lanes while only a few apply to a given site. When a companion's lane applies: if the skill is installed, use it, because it is deeper; if not, follow its entry below and say in your report which lanes ran **inline at reduced depth**. Never skip an applicable lane silently, and never claim a specialist ran when it did not.

A skill mentioned only for escalation, referral, documentation, or optional deeper follow-up is not a companion and not a dependency.

These entries are the essentials, not the full skills. Every entry shares the same rules: label claims OBSERVED / SOURCE-INDICATED / DECLARED / INFERRED / UNKNOWN / REVIEW REQUIRED; unknown is never a pass and never a failure; suspicion is not fact; fix only what is clearly safe; never invent legal terms, addresses, retention periods, testimonials, or metrics; never claim compliance; for legal specifics read the current text at an official source and cite it (`official-sources`); when changing anything visible, first look at the project's own design system and build from it.

This file contains only the entries for this skill's declared companions: `cookie-and-storage-audit`, `data-flow-mapping`, `data-rights`, `email-compliance`.

### data-flow-mapping
List every form, field, and API route that receives personal data; where it is stored (schema); which vendors receive it. Produce a table of field, storage, recipients, and how it is deleted (or unknown). Trace three fields end to end.

### cookie-and-storage-audit
In a fresh browser context, record cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and network requests before any interaction, then after reject and after accept. Classify each item as necessary, functional, analytics, advertising, embed, or unknown; unknown is not essential. Compare with the disclosure.

### email-compliance
Classify emails as transactional or marketing. For marketing: sender identity, unsubscribe link that is not `#`, a working route, a state change (suppression flag or provider suppression), and a send path that excludes suppressed addresses. Test on staging with a test address; never send real email.

### data-rights
Trace "delete account" from the UI to the database, auth provider, storage, and vendors. Soft delete (`active=false`, `deleted_at`) is retention, not deletion. Verify with a test account that no personal data remains except documented retained records. Check export and opt-out too.
